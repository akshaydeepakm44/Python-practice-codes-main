<!-- The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T, denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of three integers 
N,X, and Y, the number of problems, the maximum score for each problem, and the score Chef wants.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef can achieve exactly Y marks, NO otherwise.
You can print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings Yes, YES, yes, and yEs, are all considered identical. -->
# cook your dish here
T = int(input())  # Read number of test cases

for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
    N, X, Y = map(int, input().split())  # Read the values of N, X, and Y
    
    # Check if Y is a multiple of X and if Y is within the achievable range
    if Y % X == 0 and Y <= N * X:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
