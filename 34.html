<!-- First line will contain 
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers 
N and Xrepresenting the number of people at the party and the number of available tiles respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line YES if the game is valid, else output 
NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings 
YES will all be treated as identical). -->

T = int(input())  # Read number of test cases

for _ in range(T):  # Loop through each test case
    N, X = map(int, input().split())  # Read N (number of players) and X (number of tiles)
    
    # Check if X is divisible by N
    if X % N == 0:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
