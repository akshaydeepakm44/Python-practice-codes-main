<!-- Each pizza consists of 4 slices. There are N friends and each friend needs exactly X slices.
Find the minimum number of pizzas they should order to satisfy their appetite.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two integers N and X, the number of friends and the number of slices each friend wants respectively. -->

T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    
    N, X = map(int, input().split())
    
    total_slices = N * X
    
    pizzas_needed = (total_slices + 3) // 4 
    print(pizzas_needed)
