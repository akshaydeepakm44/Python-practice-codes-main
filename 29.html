<!-- Chefland requires 
A=1 units of power for the next 
B=2 years. In total, the moon must be capable of providing 
A⋅B=2 units of power. There are in total 
X=3 grams of Helium-3 on the moon which is capable of providing 
X⋅Y=12 units of power. 12>2, so the project satisfies the minimum requirements for funding. Thus, the answer is Yes. -->
